# US-bikeshare
In this project, I used Python to explore data provided by 'Motivate', a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States Chicago, New York City, and Washington, and uncovered bike share usage patterns.
The code takes raw input and imports the data and answer interesting questions by computing descriptive statistics.
